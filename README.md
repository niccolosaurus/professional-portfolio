Niccolo Eck's Portfolio

Contains an easy to use navigation bar, with a, About Me, Work, Contact Me and Resume section.

When you click on any of the sections it takes you to that location on the portfolio page.

The About Me section is complete with an about me section as to what I am trying to accomplish and what I "know" how to do in coding.

I have updated my works tab to include some code and projects that I have worked on.

The Contact me section contains my phone number, email address, github link and linkedin, also.  Clickin on the GitHub and LinkedIn logo will take you to the respected sites.

I also have a PDF copy of my resume on my portfolio.
